### Architectural Decisions and Design Considerations

#### 1. System Architecture:
The Library Management System will adopt a microservices architecture to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Each core functionality (cataloguing, circulation management, self-service portal) will be developed as an independent service, allowing for easier updates and deployment.

#### 2. Technology Stack:
- **Backend Framework:** The backend will be developed using Spring Boot (version 2.5.x) for its robust support for microservices and RESTful APIs.
- **Frontend Framework:** The self-service portal will utilize React (version 17.x) for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (version 13.x) will be used for relational data storage, ensuring compliance with EU data residency requirements. Additionally, Elasticsearch will be integrated for efficient search capabilities, meeting the performance requirement of sub-800 ms response times.
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 will be implemented for user authentication, leveraging an external identity provider to manage user sessions securely.
- **Payment Processing:** Integration with Stripe or PayPal APIs will be established for handling transactions related to fines and fees.

#### 3. Data Management:
- **Data Storage:** All user data, including personal information and transaction history, will be stored in PostgreSQL, ensuring compliance with GDPR. Data encryption at rest and in transit will be implemented to enhance security.
- **Search Indexing:** Elasticsearch will be utilized to index catalogued items, allowing for fast and efficient search queries. Regular indexing schedules will be established to keep the search data up-to-date.

#### 4. Performance Optimization:
- **Caching:** Redis will be employed as an in-memory caching layer to store frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.
- **Load Balancing:** A load balancer (e.g., NGINX) will be configured to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the microservices, ensuring high availability and reliability.

#### 5. Compliance and Security:
- **GDPR Compliance:** The system will implement data anonymization techniques for analytics purposes, ensuring that personal data is not exposed unnecessarily.
- **Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles (e.g., librarian, patron, administrator).

#### 6. User Experience:
- **Responsive Design:** The self-service portal will be designed to be mobile-friendly, ensuring accessibility for users on various devices.
- **User Testing:** Regular user testing sessions will be conducted to gather feedback and iterate on the user interface, ensuring it meets the needs of diverse user personas.

### Summary of Architectural Decisions
The Library Management System will be built using a microservices architecture, leveraging a technology stack that includes Spring Boot, React, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch. Key architectural decisions focus on modularity, performance optimization, compliance with GDPR, and enhancing user experience. These decisions are aimed at delivering a robust, scalable, and user-friendly library management solution that meets the outlined functional and nonfunctional requirements.
