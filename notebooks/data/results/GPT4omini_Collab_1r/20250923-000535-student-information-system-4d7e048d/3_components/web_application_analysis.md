### Comprehensive Transcript of Architectural Decisions for the Student Information System

#### Project Overview
- **Title:** Student Information System
- **Description:** Central system for universities to manage student records, enrollment, grades, and transcripts across multiple campuses.
- **Domain:** Education / Administration
- **Constraints:**
  - FERPA compliance (US) & GDPR (EU)
  - Multi-campus tenancy

#### Functional Requirements
- **R-01:** Maintain student demographic & academic records
- **R-02:** Online course enrollment & wait-listing
- **R-03:** Faculty grade submission & change history
- **R-04:** Generate official transcripts (PDF)

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **R-05:** Security - Field-level encryption for PII
- **R-06:** Integrity - Immutable audit logs for grade changes
- **R-07:** Availability - Uptime ≥ 99.8% during term
- **R-08:** Maintainability - ≤ 20% mean time to repair (MTTR) per incident

#### Target Cloud
- **Provider:** GCP
- **Regions:**
  - us-east1
  - europe-west4

### Component Analysis for the Web Application

#### Components Breakdown
1. **API Controller**
   - Responsibilities: Handle HTTP requests, validate input, route requests, return responses.
   - Endpoints: `/students`, `/enrollment`, `/grades`, `/transcripts`.

2. **Service Layer**
   - Responsibilities: Implement business logic, coordinate between controllers and repositories.
   - Key Services: `StudentService`, `EnrollmentService`, `GradeService`, `TranscriptService`.

3. **Repository Layer**
   - Responsibilities: Data access and persistence.
   - Key Repositories: `StudentRepository`, `EnrollmentRepository`, `GradeRepository`, `TranscriptRepository`.

4. **Domain Model**
   - Responsibilities: Represent core entities and relationships.
   - Key Entities: `Student`, `Course`, `Grade`, `Transcript`.

5. **Security Component**
   - Responsibilities: Implement field-level encryption, manage authentication and authorization.
   - Key Features: Encryption service, middleware for authentication checks.

6. **Audit Logging Component**
   - Responsibilities: Maintain immutable logs for critical actions.
   - Key Features: Logging service to capture changes and actions.

#### Relationships Between Components
- API Controller interacts with Service Layer.
- Service Layer interacts with Repository Layer.
- Service Layer utilizes Security Component.
- Service Layer invokes Audit Logging Component.
- Domain Model is accessed by Repository Layer.

#### Design Patterns
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer Pattern
- Decorator Pattern for Security Component

### Additional Insights and Suggestions

#### Code-Level Design Considerations
- Implement centralized error handling in the API Controller.
- Use a validation library for input validation.
- Consider asynchronous programming for I/O-bound operations.

#### Adherence to Patterns
- Consider implementing CQRS for complex operations.
- Ensure dependency injection for loose coupling.

#### Testability
- Design services and repositories with interfaces for unit testing.
- Implement integration tests for component interactions.
- Conduct end-to-end testing for API endpoints.

#### Security Enhancements
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints.
- Consider data masking for sensitive information.

#### Performance Monitoring
- Integrate a logging framework for detailed logs.
- Conduct load testing to ensure performance under peak usage.

#### Documentation
- Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
- Maintain clear comments and documentation in the codebase.

### Database-Related Aspects

#### Schema Design
- **Students Table:** `StudentID (PK)`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `Email`, `DateOfBirth`, `CampusID`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`.
- **Courses Table:** `CourseID (PK)`, `CourseName`, `Credits`, `Department`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`.
- **Enrollment Table:** `EnrollmentID (PK)`, `StudentID (FK)`, `CourseID (FK)`, `Status`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`.
- **Grades Table:** `GradeID (PK)`, `StudentID (FK)`, `CourseID (FK)`, `Grade`, `SubmittedAt`, `UpdatedAt`.
- **Transcripts Table:** `TranscriptID (PK)`, `StudentID (FK)`, `GeneratedAt`, `PDFContent`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`.

#### Query Performance
- Create indexes on frequently queried columns.
- Optimize SQL queries to ensure efficiency.

#### Data Integrity
- Implement foreign key and unique constraints.
- Use check constraints to enforce business rules.

#### Security Measures
- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data.
- Define roles and permissions for database access.
- Create an `AuditLog` table for critical actions.

#### Backup and Recovery
- Establish a backup strategy with regular backups.
- Develop a disaster recovery plan.

### Security Vulnerability Analysis

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

#### Fine-Grained Authorization
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and middleware for authorization checks.

#### Secure Coding Practices
- Implement proper error handling and ensure secure data storage.

#### Session Management
- Use secure cookie attributes and implement session expiration.

#### Audit Logging
- Implement an immutable audit logging mechanism for critical actions.

#### XSS Prevention
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers and escape output data.

#### CSRF Protection
- Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.

#### Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
