### Comprehensive Transcript of Architectural Decisions for the Student Information System (SIS)

#### 1. System Overview
- **Title:** Student Information System
- **Description:** Central system for universities to manage student records, enrollment, grades, and transcripts across multiple campuses.
- **Domain:** Education / Administration

#### 2. Constraints
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The system must comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) in the US and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU.
- **Multi-Campus Tenancy:** The architecture must support multiple campuses, allowing for data segregation and tailored access controls.

#### 3. Functional Requirements
- **R-01:** Maintain student demographic & academic records.
- **R-02:** Online course enrollment & wait-listing.
- **R-03:** Faculty grade submission & change history.
- **R-04:** Generate official transcripts (PDF).

#### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **R-05 (Security):** Implement field-level encryption for Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **R-06 (Integrity):** Maintain immutable audit logs for grade changes.
- **R-07 (Availability):** Ensure uptime of at least 99.8% during academic terms.
- **R-08 (Maintainability):** Achieve a mean time to repair (MTTR) of ≤ 20% per incident.

#### 5. Target Cloud Infrastructure
- **Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Regions:** 
  - us-east1
  - europe-west4

#### 6. User Personas
- **Students:** Need access to academic records, course enrollment, and transcripts.
- **Faculty:** Require tools for grade submission and tracking changes.
- **Administrative Staff:** Manage student records and ensure compliance.
- **IT Support Staff:** Ensure system uptime and performance.

#### 7. Business Goals
- **Compliance:** Adhere to FERPA and GDPR regulations.
- **Efficiency:** Streamline administrative tasks through automation.
- **User Satisfaction:** Enhance user experience for students and faculty.
- **Scalability:** Support operations across multiple campuses.

#### 8. External Interactions
- **Identity Management System (IMS):** For user authentication and access control.
- **Learning Management System (LMS):** For course content integration and grade updates.
- **Payment Processing System:** For handling tuition payments.
- **Compliance and Reporting Systems:** For regulatory reporting.
- **External Academic Systems:** For state and federal compliance reporting.

#### 9. High-Level Data Flow
- **User Authentication:** Credentials are verified through the IMS.
- **Enrollment Management:** Data is exchanged with the LMS for course registrations.
- **Grade Submission:** Grades submitted by faculty are updated in the LMS.
- **Payment Processing:** Payment statuses are confirmed and recorded in the SIS.
- **Compliance Reporting:** Data is compiled and sent to external systems for reporting.

#### 10. System Boundary
- The SIS focuses on student information management, excluding non-academic administrative tasks. It ensures secure and compliant interactions with external systems.

#### 11. Technical Feasibility Assessment
- **Technical Plausibility:** The system's requirements align with existing technologies and best practices.
- **Data Management Responsibilities:** Securely manage student records, enrollment, grades, and transcripts.
- **Major Constraints Identified:**
  - Regulatory compliance (FERPA, GDPR)
  - Multi-campus support
  - Security requirements (encryption, audit logs)
  - Availability and reliability (99.8% uptime)
  - Maintainability (≤ 20% MTTR)
  - Cloud provider limitations (GCP)

### Conclusion
The architectural decisions made during the design session for the Student Information System are comprehensive and address the critical needs of the educational institutions it serves. The system is designed to be secure, compliant, and efficient, with a focus on user experience and operational excellence. All decisions and requirements have been documented to ensure clarity and alignment throughout the development process.
