### Comprehensive Transcript of Architectural Decisions for the Student Information System (SIS)

#### System Overview
- **Title:** Student Information System
- **Description:** Central system for universities to manage student records, enrollment, grades, and transcripts across multiple campuses.
- **Domain:** Education / Administration
- **Constraints:**
  - FERPA compliance (US) & GDPR (EU)
  - Multi-campus tenancy

#### Functional Requirements
1. **R-01:** Maintain student demographic & academic records
2. **R-02:** Online course enrollment & wait-listing
3. **R-03:** Faculty grade submission & change history
4. **R-04:** Generate official transcripts (PDF)

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **R-05:** Security - Field-level encryption for PII
2. **R-06:** Integrity - Immutable audit logs for grade changes
3. **R-07:** Availability - Uptime ≥ 99.8% during term
4. **R-08:** Maintainability - ≤ 20% mean time to repair (MTTR) per incident

#### Target Cloud
- **Provider:** GCP
- **Regions:**
  - us-east1
  - europe-west4

### Proposed Containers
1. **Web Application (Frontend)**
   - **Description:** User interface for students, faculty, and administrative staff.
   - **Technology Stack:** React.js or Angular.
   - **Responsibilities:** User authentication, displaying records, forms for faculty.

2. **API Gateway**
   - **Description:** Centralized entry point for client requests.
   - **Technology Stack:** Google Cloud Endpoints or Apigee.
   - **Responsibilities:** Authentication, routing requests, rate limiting.

3. **Student Information API (Microservice)**
   - **Description:** Manages student demographic and academic records.
   - **Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express or Spring Boot.
   - **Responsibilities:** CRUD operations, field-level encryption, immutable audit logs.

4. **Enrollment Management API (Microservice)**
   - **Description:** Handles course enrollment and wait-listing.
   - **Technology Stack:** Python with Flask or .NET Core.
   - **Responsibilities:** Course registrations, interfacing with LMS.

5. **Grade Management API (Microservice)**
   - **Description:** For faculty to submit grades and track changes.
   - **Technology Stack:** Ruby on Rails or Java with Spring.
   - **Responsibilities:** Grade submissions, maintaining audit logs.

6. **Document Generation Service**
   - **Description:** Generates official transcripts in PDF format.
   - **Technology Stack:** Java with Apache PDFBox or Python with ReportLab.
   - **Responsibilities:** Compiling records into PDF format.

7. **Database**
   - **Description:** Relational database for storing records.
   - **Technology Stack:** Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
   - **Responsibilities:** Storing structured data securely.

8. **Message Queue**
   - **Description:** Messaging system for asynchronous communication.
   - **Technology Stack:** Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
   - **Responsibilities:** Handling events between microservices.

### High-Level Relationships
- **Web Application ↔ API Gateway:** Secure communication using HTTPS.
- **API Gateway ↔ Microservices:** Routing requests to appropriate services.
- **Microservices ↔ Database:** CRUD operations with security measures.
- **Grade Management API ↔ LMS:** Synchronization of grades.
- **Enrollment Management API ↔ LMS:** Course registration data.
- **Document Generation Service ↔ Database:** Retrieving records for transcripts.
- **Microservices ↔ Message Queue:** Asynchronous processing.

### Implementation Feasibility and Developer Experience Insights
- **Complexity of Proposed Containers:** Consider starting with a monolithic approach for rapid iteration.
- **Technology Trade-offs:** Choose frontend frameworks based on team expertise; PostgreSQL for advanced data handling.
- **Developer Experience:** Use Docker for local development; implement Swagger for API documentation.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Centralized logging for troubleshooting.

### Operational Excellence Insights
- **Deployability Considerations:** Containerize microservices; implement CI/CD pipelines.
- **Observability Strategies:** Use Google Cloud Monitoring and distributed tracing.
- **Scalability & Reliability:** Implement load balancing and auto-scaling.
- **Potential Operational Bottlenecks:** Use circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms.

### Security Analysis
- **Trust Boundaries:** Manage user, API Gateway, microservices, and database communications.
- **Data Protection in Transit:** Use TLS and mTLS for secure communications.
- **Authentication Gateways:** Centralized authentication with OAuth 2.0; implement RBAC.
- **Security Controls for Microservices:** Field-level encryption, immutable audit logs, input validation.
- **Compliance Considerations:** Data minimization, retention policies, regular security audits.

### Conclusion
The architectural decisions for the Student Information System have been meticulously documented to ensure clarity and facilitate implementation. The system is designed to meet both functional and non-functional requirements while adhering to security and compliance standards. Regular reviews and updates will be essential to adapt to evolving needs and technologies.
