### Comprehensive Transcript of Architectural Decisions for the NextGen Point-of-Sale System

#### System Overview
- **Title**: NextGen Point-of-Sale
- **Description**: Store-front POS inspired by Craig Larman’s case study; supports bar-code scanning, promotions, and offline queueing when networks fail.
- **Domain**: Retail / Point-of-Sale
- **Constraints**:
  - PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance
  - Offline transaction buffering ≤ 24 h

#### Functional Requirements
- **R-01**: Scan items & compute totals with tax rules per locale
- **R-02**: Apply promotions & loyalty points in real time
- **R-03**: Process card payments via Stripe Terminal
- **R-04**: Print or email receipt with QR-code

#### Nonfunctional Requirements
- **R-05**: Performance - Complete sale in ≤ 500 ms P95
- **R-06**: Availability - Uptime ≥ 99.9%
- **R-07**: Reliability - No lost sales during network outages
- **R-08**: Usability - Cashier workflow ≤ 4 clicks

#### Target Cloud
- **Provider**: AWS
- **Regions**:
  - us-east-1
  - eu-west-1

### C4 Component Analysis for 'API Gateway'

#### Components
1. **API Controller**
   - Responsibilities: Handle incoming HTTP requests, route requests, validate data, handle authentication/authorization.
   - Interfaces: Exposes RESTful endpoints for each functional requirement.

2. **Service Layer**
   - Responsibilities: Encapsulate business logic, interact with the repository layer, coordinate between services.
   - Components:
     - **TransactionService**: Manages scanning items, computing totals, applying promotions.
     - **PaymentService**: Handles payment processing via Stripe Terminal.
     - **ReceiptService**: Manages receipt generation and delivery.
   - Interfaces: Exposes methods for the API Controller to call.

3. **Repository Layer**
   - Responsibilities: Abstract data access logic, provide methods for CRUD operations.
   - Components:
     - **TransactionRepository**: Handles transaction data.
     - **PromotionRepository**: Manages promotion data.
     - **ReceiptRepository**: Stores receipt data.
   - Interfaces: Exposes methods for data operations.

4. **Domain Model**
   - Responsibilities: Define core entities and relationships, represent business rules.
   - Components:
     - **Transaction**: Represents a sale transaction.
     - **Promotion**: Represents promotional offers.
     - **Receipt**: Represents receipt details.
   - Interfaces: Includes methods for validation and business logic.

#### Relationships
- API Controller interacts with Service Layer, which communicates with Repository Layer and utilizes Domain Model.

#### Design Patterns
- Controller-Service-Repository Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Factory Pattern, Adapter Pattern.

### Additional Insights and Suggestions for the API Gateway Component Design

1. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - Centralized error handling middleware.
   - Circuit Breaker pattern for external service calls.

2. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
   - Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Define cache invalidation strategy and implement a caching layer.

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - API key management and OAuth2 for authentication.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Structured logging and distributed tracing.

6. **Unit Testing and Testability**
   - Mocking external services and ensuring high test coverage.

7. **Documentation and API Specification**
   - Create OpenAPI specification and define versioning strategy.

### Database-Related Aspects for the API Gateway Component

#### Schema Design
1. **Transaction Table**
   - Table Name: `transactions`
   - Columns: `id`, `cashier_id`, `total_amount`, `payment_status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
   - Indexes: On `cashier_id` and `created_at`.

2. **Promotion Table**
   - Table Name: `promotions`
   - Columns: `id`, `description`, `discount_percentage`, `start_date`, `end_date`.
   - Indexes: On `start_date` and `end_date`.

3. **Receipt Table**
   - Table Name: `receipts`
   - Columns: `id`, `transaction_id`, `format`, `sent_at`.
   - Indexes: On `transaction_id`.

#### Query Performance
- Use of indexes to improve query performance and regular analysis of query performance.

#### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints and check constraints to maintain data integrity.

#### Additional Considerations
- Data retention policy and backup/recovery strategy.

### Security Analysis for the API Gateway Component

1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Validation of incoming data and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

2. **Fine-Grained Authorization**
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and claims-based authorization.

3. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets and implement proper error handling.

4. **Authentication and Session Management**
   - Secure authentication using OAuth2 and session management best practices.

5. **Transport Layer Security**
   - HTTPS enforcement and HSTS implementation.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Audit logging and anomaly detection.

7. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**
   - Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.

8. **Security Testing**
   - Regular penetration testing and static code analysis.
