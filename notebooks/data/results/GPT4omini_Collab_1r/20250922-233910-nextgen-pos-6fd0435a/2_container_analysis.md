- **R-03**: Process card payments via Stripe Terminal.
- **R-04**: Print or email receipt with QR-code.

#### Nonfunctional Requirements
- **R-05**: Complete sale in ≤ 500 ms P95.
- **R-06**: Uptime ≥ 99.9%.
- **R-07**: No lost sales during network outages.
- **R-08**: Cashier workflow ≤ 4 clicks.

#### Target Cloud
- **Provider**: AWS
- **Regions**:
  - us-east-1
  - eu-west-1

### Proposed Containers

   - **Responsibilities**: Handle user interactions, communicate with the backend API.
   - **Communication Protocol**: HTTPS.

2. **API Gateway**
   - **Description**: Node.js and Express-based API.
   - **Technology**: Node.js, Express.
   - **Responsibilities**: Handle authentication, route requests to microservices.
   - **Communication Protocol**: RESTful API over HTTPS.

3. **Transaction Management Service**
   - **Description**: Microservice for managing transactions.
   - **Technology**: Node.js, Express.
   - **Responsibilities**: Process item scans, apply promotions.
   - **Communication Protocol**: RESTful API over HTTPS.

4. **Payment Processing Service**
   - **Description**: Microservice for payment processing via Stripe.
   - **Technology**: Node.js, Express.
   - **Responsibilities**: Integrate with Stripe's SDK.
   - **Communication Protocol**: RESTful API over HTTPS.

5. **Receipt Generation Service**
   - **Description**: Microservice for generating and sending receipts.
   - **Technology**: Node.js, Express.
   - **Responsibilities**: Generate receipts, integrate with email service.
   - **Communication Protocol**: RESTful API over HTTPS.

6. **Database**
   - **Description**: PostgreSQL database with Redis for caching.
   - **Technology**: PostgreSQL, Redis.
   - **Responsibilities**: Store transaction data, promotions.
   - **Communication Protocol**: SQL for database interactions.

7. **Local Storage Service**
   - **Description**: SQLite database for offline transaction buffering.
   - **Technology**: SQLite.
   - **Responsibilities**: Store transactions locally during outages.
   - **Communication Protocol**: Local file system access.

8. **Monitoring and Logging Service**
   - **Description**: Service for collecting logs and metrics.
   - **Technology**: AWS CloudWatch or similar.
   - **Responsibilities**: Monitor performance, log transactions.
   - **Communication Protocol**: AWS SDK.

### Implementation Feasibility and Technology Trade-offs
- **Frontend Web Application**: React.js is flexible but may require additional tooling.
- **API Gateway**: Node.js is efficient but may not suit CPU-intensive tasks.
- **Transaction Management Service**: Complexity in real-time promotions requires careful design.
- **Payment Processing Service**: Reliance on Stripe introduces external dependencies.
- **Receipt Generation Service**: Email service provider may incur additional costs.
- **Database**: Managing PostgreSQL and Redis increases operational complexity.
- **Local Storage Service**: SQLite may struggle with concurrent writes.
- **Monitoring and Logging Service**: Single monitoring solution may limit visibility.

### Operational Considerations
- **Deployability**: Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Observability**: Implement centralized logging and metrics collection.
- **Scalability & Reliability**: Configure auto-scaling and conduct load testing.
- **Security Measures**: Use AWS VPC, implement RBAC, and conduct regular audits.

### Security Analysis
- **Trust Boundaries**: Secure communication between containers and enforce authentication.
- **Data Protection in Transit**: Use TLS and consider mTLS for service-to-service communication.
- **Authentication Gateways**: Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure token-based authentication.
- **Data Protection at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data using AWS KMS.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Ensure robust error handling and centralized logging.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct audits and penetration testing for compliance.

### Conclusion
The architectural decisions for the NextGen Point-of-Sale system have been thoroughly documented, addressing functional and non-functional requirements, operational considerations, and security measures. This comprehensive transcript serves as a foundational reference for the development, deployment, and maintenance of the system, ensuring alignment with best practices and compliance standards.
