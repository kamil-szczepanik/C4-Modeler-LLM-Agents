#### Target Cloud
- **Provider:** Hybrid
- **Regions:**
  - on-prem-k8s
  - eu-central-1

### Proposed Containers
1. **User Interface (UI) Container**
   - **Technology Stack:** React, Redux, Axios
   - **Responsibilities:** Patient registration, appointment scheduling, EMR display, billing.

2. **Patient Management Microservice**
   - **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
   - **Responsibilities:** Manage patient demographics and registration.

3. **Appointment Management Microservice**
   - **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
   - **Responsibilities:** Schedule appointments and check for resource conflicts.

4. **Electronic Medical Records (EMR) Microservice**
   - **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, MongoDB
   - **Responsibilities:** Store and retrieve EMR data, maintain audit trails.

5. **Billing Microservice**
   - **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, PostgreSQL
   - **Responsibilities:** Manage billing information and insurance claims.

6. **API Gateway**
   - **Technology Stack:** Kong or AWS API Gateway
   - **Responsibilities:** Manage and secure access to microservices.

7. **Authentication Service**
   - **Technology Stack:** Spring Boot, JWT
   - **Responsibilities:** Implement multi-factor authentication, enforce RBAC.

8. **Centralized Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Technology Stack:** ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana
   - **Responsibilities:** Collect and analyze logs, monitor performance metrics.

9. **Data Retention and Archiving Service**
   - **Technology Stack:** Custom service using Spring Boot
   - **Responsibilities:** Implement data retention policies, archive older data.

### High-Level Relationships
- **UI ↔ API Gateway:** UI communicates with API Gateway using HTTPS.
- **API Gateway ↔ Microservices:** API Gateway routes requests to microservices.
- **Microservices ↔ Databases:** Each microservice interacts with its respective database.
- **Authentication Service ↔ API Gateway:** API Gateway delegates authentication to the Authentication Service.
- **Centralized Logging ↔ Microservices:** Each microservice sends logs to the centralized logging system.
- **Data Retention Service ↔ Databases:** This service interacts with databases for data retention.

### Implementation Feasibility and Developer Experience
- **Microservices Complexity:** Requires expertise in microservices patterns.
- **Database Management:** Expertise needed for PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- **API Gateway Configuration:** Complexity in security configurations.
- **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:** Requires setup and maintenance knowledge.

### Operational Excellence
- **Deployability:** Use Docker for containerization, CI/CD for automation, Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Observability:** Centralized logging with ELK, distributed tracing, performance monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana.
- **Scalability & Reliability:** Horizontal scaling, load balancing, service mesh, failover strategies.
- **Potential Bottlenecks:** Database performance, API Gateway latency, inter-service communication.
- **Failure Modes:** Service outages, data consistency issues, security breaches.

### Security Analysis
- **Trust Boundaries:** Secure communication between microservices and data storage.
- **Data Protection in Transit:** Use TLS and mTLS for secure communications.
- **Authentication Gateways:** API Gateway handles authentication, implements MFA and RBAC.
- **Security Measures:** Data encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits, logging and monitoring.
- **Compliance Considerations:** Ensure alignment with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.

### Recommendations
- **Unified Database Solution:** Consider a single database technology.
- **Lightweight Frameworks:** Explore alternatives to Spring Boot for microservices.
- **Simplify Frontend Frameworks:** Assess simpler frameworks for the UI.
- **Enhance DevOps Capabilities:** Invest in training for hybrid cloud management.
- **Focus on Documentation and Training:** Prioritize comprehensive documentation and training sessions.
