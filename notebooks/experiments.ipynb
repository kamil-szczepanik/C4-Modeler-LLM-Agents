The direct exposure of the Web Application and the central role of the API Container, without an API Gateway or dedicated Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, significantly broaden the attack surface. Sensitive patron data stored in the Database Container is a primary target, and its protection relies heavily on the security posture of the API layer. External integrations, particularly with the Email/SMS Notification Services, introduce additional vectors for information disclosure. Overall, the system lacks robust security hardening, centralized security enforcement, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities, making it susceptible to various common web attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.\",\n",

At the Context Level, including 'Azure' as an ExternalSystem interacting with the LMS is conceptually incorrect in a C4 context diagram; Azure is the platform. The PlantUML also lists specific technologies for the LMS (Python, Django, etc.) which are absent from the YAML definition, creating a minor inconsistency in detail. At the Container Level, the PlantUML diagram incorrectly places 'Librarian' and 'Patron' inside the System_Boundary; C4 defines people as external to the system. The most significant clarity issue is the introduction of Java Spring Boot as the technology for containers, directly contradicting the Python/Django stack mentioned in the Context diagram. This creates major confusion. The diagram also fails to represent containers for all core functional requirements, making the overall system incomplete. At the Component Level for Account Management, the 'Dependency Management Component' using 'pip' is inconsistent with the declared 'Java Spring Boot' technology for the container, further muddying the technology stack. The complete absence of both YAML and PlantUML for the 'Catalog Search' container is a significant gap in communication, leaving a core part of the system undefined. Overall, while the C4 structure is followed, the content suffers from critical inconsistencies in technology stack declarations, conceptual errors in C4 diagramming, and significant omissions, severely hindering effective communication.\",\n",
