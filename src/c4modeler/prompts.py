**This output is critical as it will be used as a direct input for an automated process, so it must be a complete and unfiltered record of the facts.**

Your role is to **compile and integrate** every insight from the collaborative discussion into a final, consolidated report.

1.  **DO NOT SUMMARIZE:** Your task is to collate and transcribe, not to condense or interpret. Every point, proposal, critique, and decision must be captured.
2.  **PRESERVE EVERY FACT:** No detail is too small. If a technology, version number, security concern, or component name was mentioned as part of a final decision, it must be included in the report.
3.  **CONSOLIDATE WITHOUT OMISSION:** You must logically structure the final output, but you must ensure that this consolidation process does not lead to any information loss. Integrate all points into one coherent document.
